matlab-notify
=============
Some notifications for matlab. Just call notify with some message

Usage
=====
You'll need to set up the username/password in the email settings, then call:
>> notify('hello from matlab!');
That's it!

Notes

1. I put notify.m in ~/Library/MATLAB and added this to my path.
2. This doesn't require sendmail or anything else.
